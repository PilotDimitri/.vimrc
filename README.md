# .vimrc
My default .vimrc profile

1. Add these directories:
```
mkdir ~/.vim/backup/ && mkdir ~/.vim/swap/ && mkdir ~/.vim/undo/
```
2. Go to system settings -> keyboard -> key repeat (fast) && delay unit repeat (short) to make the navigation much more faster in VIM.

Note: You can try this out too: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0`
